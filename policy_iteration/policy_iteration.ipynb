    "# Policy Iteration Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy Iteration is a method used to solve Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). It alternates between two steps: policy evaluation and policy improvement, iteratively improving the policy until it converges to the optimal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps of the Policy Iteration Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "    - Start with an arbitrary policy $\\pi$.\n",
    "    - Initialize the value function $V(s)$ for all states $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Policy Evaluation**:\n",
    "    - Compute the value function $V^\\pi(s) $ for the current policy $\\pi$ by solving the Bellman equation:  \n",
    "        $$  \n",
    "        V^\\pi(s) = \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s, \\pi(s)) \\left[ R(s, \\pi(s), s') + \\gamma V^\\pi(s') \\right]  \n",
    "        $$  \n",
    "        where:  \n",
    "        - $P(s'|s, a)$: Transition probability.  \n",
    "        - $R(s, a, s')$: Reward for transitioning from state \\( s \\) to \\( s' \\) using action \\( a \\).  \n",
    "        - $\\gamma$: Discount factor. \n",
    "    - Update the policy by acting greedily with respect to the value function:\n",
    "      $$\n",
    "      \\pi'(s) = \\arg\\max_a \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s, a) \\left[ R(s, a, s') + \\gamma V^\\pi(s') \\right]\n",
    "      $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convergence**:\n",
    "    - Repeat the policy evaluation and policy improvement steps until the policy no longer changes (i.e., it converges to the optimal policy $\\pi^*$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy Iteration is guaranteed to converge to the optimal policy in a finite number of iterations for finite MDPs.\n"

    "\n",
    "The FrozenLake environment is a classic reinforcement learning problem where the agent must navigate a grid world to reach the goal while avoiding holes. The environment is stochastic, meaning the agent's actions may not always lead to the intended outcome.\n",

    "### Environment Details:\n",
    "- **Environment Name**: `FrozenLake8x8-v1`\n",
    "- **Grid Size**: 8x8\n",
    "- **Objective**: Navigate from the starting point to the goal while avoiding holes.\n",
    "- **Actions**: Discrete actions represented by numbers:\n",
    "    - `0`: Left\n",
    "    - `1`: Down\n",
    "    - `2`: Right\n",
    "    - `3`: Up\n",
    "- **Rewards**: A reward of 1 is given for reaching the goal; otherwise, the reward is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Workflow:\n",
    "1. **Policy Iteration**:\n",
    "    - Use the Policy Iteration algorithm to compute the optimal policy for the FrozenLake environment.\n",
    "    - The algorithm alternates between policy evaluation and policy improvement until convergence.\n",

    "2. **Evaluation**:\n",
    "    - Evaluate the optimal policy by running multiple episodes and calculating the average score.\n",

    "3. **Visualization**:\n",
    "    - Test the optimal policy by running a single episode and rendering the environment to visualize the agent's behavior.\n",
